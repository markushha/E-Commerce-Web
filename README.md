### E-Commerce-Web
#### This project was created for 24 hours
#### This is a simple E-Commerce Website built using Create-React-App
#### Tech Stack:
- React.js as a main framework
- React-Router-DOM for navigation
- SCSS & Tailwind.css for styling components
- MY JSON Server for hosting a mock JSON file with products
- and a few another libraries to make the user experience better

#### Realized for bonus points:
- Cart with total price
- Filters for the highest and lowest price

#### Todo list (due to time limits):
- Need to fix div when the description is being opened
- Need to add quantity controller for cart
- Need to separate hooks from JSX
